            A video game is played on a video game console.
A video game console is a device that can output a video and audio signal to a TV, monitor or other projection device that one or more people can play.
The first commercial home video game console was the Magnavox Odyssey. It was sold by Magnavox between 1972 and 1975, selling around 350,000 units.
There are three main types of video game consoles and they are home video game consoles, handheld video game consoles and hybrid video game consoles.
A home video game console connects to a TV (Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, etc.).
A handheld video game console is portable and can be played anywhere (Game Boy, Nintendo DS, etc.).

The first console to have an internal memory storage was the SEGA Saturn.
